# NearFuture

Near future is a top-down 2D pixel-style video game with a focus on sustainability. Our world has been destroyed by pollution caused by the evil Dr. Pollutio and swarmed by evil environmental hazards, and they must be stopped! The main character, Sam, seeks to save the world by fighting these hazards and applying critical thinking in increasingly challenging levels.

Environmental hazards are CPU enemies who are seeking to pollute the world, but they can be defeated by the playerâ€™s strategic use of dynamic combat. These hazards flood the road to the evil Dr. Pollutio, who Sam must defeat! Beyond direct combat, the player must also solve occasional puzzles in order to progress, providing a cerebral twist to the main gameplay loop. 

Near Future is ultimately about making a positive impact and saving the planet. It seeks to educate the player through an engaging experience and encourage greener choices in the real world. This project was completed by a team of seven developers: Catherine Baker, Diego Bobrow, Victoria Ploerer, JP Selame, Owen Stone, Suvra Majumder, and Nikhil Bapat.

To play this game please download the files from this repository and unzip the project. In the NearFuture-main folder that unzips, you will find an icon of an environmental hazard (a trash bag) which you can double click to open the game. Please note your device may require you to manually authorize opening software downloaded off the internet in your security settings.
